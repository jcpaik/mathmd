> __Definition [sofa].__ A shape $S$ is a _sofa_ if it is connected and there exists a rigid motion $f_- : [a, b] \to \mathcal{T}$ such that the followings hold.

> - $f_t(S) \subseteq L$ for all $t \in [a, b]$. That is, the sofa stays inside the hallway $L$ at all the time.
> - $f_b(S) \subseteq L_V$. That is, the sofa ends in the vertical side $L_H$ of the hallway.

> __Remark [sofa-def]__. One may question why we restrict a sofa to a shape. That is, a bounded and closed set. The rationale behind it is this: ^rem-sofa-def

> - If an arbitrary set $S$ which might not be closed admits the same movement $f$ inside the hallway $L$, then its closure $\overline{S}$ also admits the same movement $f$ as the hallway parts $L, L_H, L_V$ are closed. So it does not hurt generality to assume that $S$ is closed.
> - Even if there is an unbounded sofa $S$, its area can be approximated as much as we want by the intersection of $S$ with a disk of sufficiently large radius $R$ centered at the origin. So the supremum of the area of sofa $S$ is the same even if we restrict to bounded $S$. We will eventually prove that the Gerver's sofa $S_\text{Gerver}$, which is bounded, attains the supremum of the sofa area. So this suffice to cover even the unbounded case if desired.
