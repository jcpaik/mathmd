Some preface

_Proof._ (of [[#^thm-cap-hallway-intersection]]) Let $S$ be any moving sofa with rotation angle $\omega \in (0, \pi/2]$ in standard position. Let $K = \mathcal{C}(S)$. That $S \subseteq K$ is an immediate consequence of the third condition of [[15. Monotone sofas/07. Tangent Hallway#^thm-moving-sofa-iff-hallway-intersection]]. We now show that $K$ is a cap with rotation angle $\omega$. â–¡
